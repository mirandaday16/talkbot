# talkbot
Talkbot is a project I began when I first started learning Python, and Iâ€™ve been tinkering with it ever since. I designed a prototype of an interactive chatbot using the spaCy NLP library for Python. 

Talkbot is a work in progress, but so far he understands concepts such as singular/plural nouns, first/second person, and possession.
